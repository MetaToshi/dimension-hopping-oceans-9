Beanie: Flow! The headmaster tasked us with clearing slugs in the west wing.
Flow: We’re on slug duty, again?! 
Beanie: Yeah. 
Flow: OK, I guess I’ll take care of it.
Beanie: Hey, I’m helping you! 
Flow: Oh yeah? Like last time when I got rid of twice as many slugs as you? 
Beanie: It wasn’t twice as many!! I got rid of 19 of ‘em!! 
Flow: And I got rid of 25. 
Beanie: … That’s not double, though. 
Flow: Beanie, the longer we wait, the more slugs come in.
Beanie: Yeah, let’s get going.
Flow: Last one there is cleaning the wing!! 
Beanie: Hey, wait! That’s not fair!! You have a head start!! Hey!!
